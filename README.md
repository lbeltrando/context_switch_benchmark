# benchmark_thread_and_processus
Student project, a benchmark tools that compute time for a context switch (beetween two threads or process).
A report is available in french.
Makefile generate five executables :
- processus_test, thread_test that compute time for respectively open, close and notify a process / thread
- test_context_proc, test_context_thread that compute time for a context swith beetween respectively two process / threads
- test_time that compute time for a simple for loop
All results are display in french for now (student project)
